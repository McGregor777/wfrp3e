    "description": "<p>Whilst physicians are experts in diagnosing maladies and deciding what sort of treatments they require to cure, they are not necessarily skilled in the preparation of medicine. Apothecaries prepare and supply the medicines prescribed by physicians. They master different areas of expertise, from the vanguard of alchemical research to folk remedies passed down generations by word of mouth. They deal mostly in mineral or chemical preparations, but may also stock herbs renowned for their healing properties, such as spiderleaf or gesundheit.</p>\n<p>The Apothecaries&rsquo; Guild is not as powerful as the Physicians&rsquo; Guild, and often has to defer to it when there is a conflict of interest between members of the professions. Nevertheless, the Apothecaries&rsquo; Guild does look out for the interests of its members. It can provide them with sources of reliable ingredients, customers in need of particular medicines and it prosecutes charlatans and other competitors. It is a profession that demands great skill, and many apothecaries become quite adept at diagnosing symptoms of common conditions themselves. Guild law allows them to prescribe for minor ailments, though few ever do so in order to avoid resentment from physicians.</p>\n<p>Some unscrupulous apothecaries are not so interested in curing the ills of their customers as they are in hooking them onto addictive substances. They manufacture stimulant chemicals such as daemon dust and laughing powder, or they cultivate the hallucinogenic weirdroot and the soporific black lotus. Such apothecaries can make a lucrative trade by selling their wares to assassins and crime lords, or by distributing them themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Typical Trappings:</strong> Apothecaries typically wear a tough leather jerkin to protect them from burns and splashing chemicals. They use a variety of tools for their trade, including measuring spoons, pestle and mortar, and various vials of liquid, bunches of herbs and jars of powder.</p>\n<p><strong>Career Ability:</strong> Add <span style=\"color: white; -webkit-text-stroke: 1pt black;\">â—¼</span> to determine the effects of any healing draught you imbibe or administer to another character</p>",
