General training covers evaluation and understanding of the basics of trade as a business and component of Empire life. Specialisation introduces focus on one particular type of trade or livelihood.</p>\n<p>Tradecraft covers both hands-on, practical applications of trades and handicrafts and the commerce and business acumen necessary to earn a living. The characteristic used depends on the demands of the trade, as determined by the GM.</p>\n<p><em>Specialisation options:</em> smithing, carpentry, jewellery making, brewing, engineering, performance</p>",
