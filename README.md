# Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay - 3rd Edition's Game System for Foundry VTT

A **_Foundry VTT_** Game System for **_Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay - 3rd Edition_**.

---

Playable _Characters_, _Parties_, _Creatures_ and _Groups_ are all implemented and functional, as well as **special WFRP3e dice**.

The Game System comes with a __Character Generator__ to speed up the playable character creation process.

Checks have a high level of automation, allowing players to __choose the amount of dice of each type__, to __add symbols to the final result__, __select effects to trigger__, and more.

__Action effects__ can trigger scripts to automate their behaviours.

Make sure to let me know about any issue you encounter, or if you enjoy the system as it already is.
