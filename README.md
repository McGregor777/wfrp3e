# wfrp3e

A Foundry VTT game system for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay - 3rd Edition.

As Playable Characters should work as intended, being fully functional, the NPC and Creatures are yet to be completed, being usable without being totally finished.

Special WFRP3E dice are implemented and functionnal, even though everything is not perfectly set up.

The level of automation is at its lowest for the moment, only making sure things that needs to be calculated on the fly are computed by the system and not by the players; this will change in the future, but I can't make any promise for a specific date at the moment.

Make sure to let me know about any issue you encounter, or if you enjoy the system as it already is.
